## 📌 Project Objective

The objective is to predict the **house sale price** (`SalePrice`) using key features from the Ames Housing Dataset:

- **`GrLivArea`** → Above ground living area (in square feet)
- **`BedroomAbvGr`** → Number of bedrooms above ground
- **`FullBath`** → Number of full bathrooms
